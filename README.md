# Email-Spam-Detection-System-NLP-PROJECT-
# 📧 Email Spam Detection using NLP & ML

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Machine Learning model to classify emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam).

## 📌 Features
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, stemming, stopword removal)
- Feature extraction with CountVectorizer
- Classification using Naive Bayes
- Model saving and reuse

## 🛠️ Libraries
- pandas, numpy, sklearn, nltk, pickle, seaborn, matplotlib

## 📊 Accuracy
Achieved ~98% accuracy using Multinomial Naive Bayes.

## 🔄 How to Use
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `notebooks/spam_detection.ipynb`
3. Load `model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl` for predictions

## 🔮 Future Work
- UI Deployment using Streamlit
- Use TF-IDF Vectorizer
